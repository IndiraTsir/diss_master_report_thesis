\section{Introduction}
The tiger mosquito (\textit{Aedes albopictus}) is an invasive species known for its ability to transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya \cite{BONIZZONI2013460}.
Since its initial detection in France, this species has rapidly expanded its range due to climate change, creating favorable conditions for its survival. 
The French population, lacking natural immunity to these diseases, faces significant health risks.

Traditional surveillance methods have proven valuable but are constrained by limited data, resources, and the need for large-scale, real-time monitoring. 
Recent advances in crowdsensing and citizen science offer a promising solution to these challenges by engaging the public in data collection efforts \cite{Sousa-2022}.

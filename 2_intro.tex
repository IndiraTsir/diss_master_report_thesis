DRAFT ONE (modified the entire structure (add penelope clean water??), mosquito is problem, what problem? Problem health, problem social activity, identified as problem by governement.
Also cities is good for them, since still water and density
Since can not do anything for density, focus on water containerswhy it's important?
Mosquito identify best water for laying eggs
Mosquito have great senses and can sense even microorganisms
ALSO MAYBE CITE PENELOPE DUVAL STUDY ON CLEAN WATER???
We take garbage water and see what happens
How abiotic affect moicroorganism and vice versa
we search for covariations of microbes and micropolluants
who affect who and howwww according to colonisation status
big graph to see that all if possible

\section{Introduction}
The tiger mosquito (\textit{Aedes albopictus}) is an invasive species known for its ability to transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya \cite{BONIZZONI2013460}. Since its initial detection in France, this species has rapidly expanded its range due to climate change, creating favorable conditions for its survival. 
A 2020 parliamentary report highlighted that the ongoing spread of the Asian tiger mosquito in France represents a growing public health concern for the coming decades \cite{naillet2020rapport}.

The French population, lacking natural immunity to these diseases, faces significant health risks and new infection cases that are reported, trigger immediate vector control responses from the city officials \cite{dengue_lyon}. 


At the community level, beyond the health issues, the economic and social impact is substantial. The aggressive daytime biting behavior of this mosquito reduces outdoor activities, diminishing personal well-being and individuals comfort \cite{haderer:hal-00783873}. Schools, parks, and neighborhoods experience reduced livability, necessitating community-driven responses to mosquito control.

On a broader scale, the increasing presence of \textit{Aedes albopictus} in France poses nationwide public health risks, necessitating the development of scalable intervention models that could serve as templates for other regions facing similar threats \cite{article}.



AXELLE EXPE:

We know from previous studies that the developement of this species is reinforced in cities compared to rural areas for several reasons.
One of the reasons lies in the fact that mosquitoes are attracted to still water containers, which are suitable oviposition (the process of laying eggs) habitats for mosquitoes, including the Asian tiger mosquito \cite{duval2022how}. Cities and urban areas provide a great number of human-made water containers (e.g. gutters, flat roofs, sewers, or rainwater collectors) for them.
Another reason, that could be cited, is the demographic density of large cities like Lyon that are able to provide good opportunities for feeding the females.

Consequently understanding the attractivity of the artificial water containers, available in the city, could help the future policies on this subject, since the process of selecting a location and laying eggs (oviposition), represent the most critical actions for the female mosquito, as it will directly influence everything from the egg hatching, juvenile development rate, and the larvae or the pupae survival. 

It have been noted that female mosquitoes are able to identify aquatic habitats suitable for the growth and survival of their offspring by relying on features such as water color, size, and exposure to sunlight. They also assess water quality using their sense of smell and touch \cite{insects7040065}. More recent research has shown that volatile chemicals produced by microbes in the water can serve as important environmental cues that influence mosquito foraging and egg-laying behavior \cite{microorganisms9081589}.

Traditional observation methods have proven valuable but are more constrained by the lack of data analysis methods performed by the biologist researchers compared to the informatics researchers. Recent advances in interdisciplinary sciences offer a promising solution to these challenges by engaging the power of data science and AI, to further develop better suited solutions \cite{}.

And that's what we're gonna do.

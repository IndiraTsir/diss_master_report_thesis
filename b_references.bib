    abstract = {The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is well adapted to urban environments and takes advantage of the artificial containers that proliferate in anthropized landscapes. Little is known about the physicochemical, pollutant, and microbiota compositions of Ae. albopictus-colonized aquatic habitats and whether these properties differ with noncolonized habitats. We specifically addressed this question in French community gardens by investigating whether pollution gradients (characterized either by water physicochemical properties combined with pollution variables or by the presence of organic molecules in water) influence water microbial composition and then the presence/absence of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Interestingly, we showed that the physicochemical and microbial compositions of noncolonized and colonized waters did not significantly differ, with the exception of N2O and CH4 concentrations, which were higher in noncolonized water samples. Moreover, the microbial composition of larval habitats covaried differentially along the pollution gradients according to colonization status. This study opens new avenues on the impact of pollution on mosquito habitats in urban areas and raises questions on the influence of biotic and abiotic interactions on adult life-history traits and their ability to transmit pathogens to humans.},

abstract = {Groundwater contamination poses serious threats to public health and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we explore smart groundwater contamination sensing, which aims to accurately estimate the nitrate concentration in groundwater via a crowdsensing approach. Existing solutions often require professional groundwater collection and high-quality measurement of groundwater properties, making the data collection process time-consuming and unscalable. In this work, we leverage the approximate nitrate concentration measured by crowd sensors (i.e., participants from well-dependent communities) to accurately estimate nitrate concentration in groundwater samples. Three critical challenges exist in developing the crowdsensing-based groundwater contamination estimation solution: (i) the spatial irregularity of the crowdsensing groundwater contamination data, (ii) the hidden temporal dependency of groundwater contamination in the anthropogenic context, and (iii) the uncertainty of crowdsensing nitrate measurements from crowd sensors. To address the above challenges, we develop CrowdWaterSens, an uncertainty-aware graph neural network framework that explicitly examines the uncertainty and spatial irregularity of the crowdsensing groundwater contamination data and its relevant anthropogenic context to accurately estimate groundwater nitrate concentration. We evaluate the CrowdWaterSens framework through two real-world case studies in well-dependent communities in Northern Indiana, United States. The evaluation results not only show the effectiveness of CrowdWaterSens in accurately estimating nitrate concentration, but also demonstrate the viability of crowdsensing for community-level groundwater quality monitoring.}

Because of this need, the unique web-based Real-time Environmental Applications and Display sYstem (READY) has been under continuous development since 1997 to provide access to a suite of tools for producing air parcel trajectory and dispersion model results and displaying meteorological data. READY provides a “quasi-operational” portal to run the HYSPLIT atmospheric transport and dispersion model and interpret its results. Typical user applications include modeling the release of hazardous pollutants and volcanic ash, forest fire and prescribed burn smoke forecasting, poor air quality events, and various climatological studies. In addition, READY provides the user with quick access to meteorological data interpolated to the location of interest, helping in the interpretation of the HYSPLIT model results.}

ABSTRACT = {Citizen science mosquito surveillance has been growing in recent years due to both increasing concern about mosquito-borne disease and the increasing popularity of citizen science projects globally. Health authorities are recognising the potential importance of citizen science to expanding or enhancing traditional surveillance programs. Different programs have shown success in engaging communities to monitor species of medical importance through low-cost methods. The Mozzie Monitors project was established on iNaturalist—an open citizen science platform that allows participants to upload photos (i.e., observers) and assist identification (i.e., identifiers). This article describes the likelihood of citizen scientists submitting photos of mosquitoes, assesses user submission behaviour, and evaluates public health utility from these citizen science-derived data. From October 2018 to July 2021, the Mozzie Monitors project on iNaturalist received 2118 observations of 57 different species of mosquitoes across Australia. The number of observers in the system increased over time with more than 500 observers and 180 identifiers being active in the project since its establishment. Data showed species bias with large-bodied and colourful mosquitoes being over-represented. Analyses also indicate regional differentiation of mosquito fauna per state, seasonality of activity, and ecological information about mosquitoes. The iNaturalist citizen science platform also allows connectedness, facilitated communication and collaboration between overall users and expert entomologists, of value to medical entomology and mosquito management.},

 abstract = {Global concern regarding mosquito-borne disease emergence and re-emergence has driven the development of citizen science mosquito surveillance initiatives. Although these initiatives have shown great potential to assist local health authorities, ensuring outcomes are translatable to improved public health policy and practice remains challenging. Here we present a summary of citizen science mosquito surveillance programs worldwide, their focus, strategies, and outcomes, with a view to how best to apply this approach in their local areas. A scoping review of studies and reports was conducted through systematic search on electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar), grey literature, and other documents listed in the references of selected articles. A total of 33 citizen science studies included in this review described 29 citizen science mosquito surveillance projects operating in 16 countries, besides three programs with wide geographic coverage. The selected programs focused on different strategies and methods according to their local and national contextual needs. The majority of the programs reported being free or low in cost, and amenable to participants. Also, citizen scientists valued the opportunity to actively contribute to a scientific activity in which they saw value. Local and national programs have been successful in involving the broader public and yielding data on mosquito populations. However, to ensure the best public health outcomes, sustainability, and scalability, there is a need to continue engaging with stakeholders, including community members, researchers, public health agents, industry, and policymakers, and to bridge existing collaborations across different sectors.},
